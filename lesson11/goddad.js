//This code can be used to determine whether a warranty is valid. The code first checks if the warranty limits remedy for defects. 
//If it does, the code then checks if the defects are so prevalent that the limited remedy fails its essential purpose.
 //If they are, the code returns true, indicating that the buyer may institute an action to recover damages for breach of warranty. Otherwise, the code returns false, 
 //indicating that the buyer may not institute an action to recover damages for breach of warranty.
